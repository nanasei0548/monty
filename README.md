monty: Our custom interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, that has specific instructions to manipulate it. The Goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Requirements
All files compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Allow to use max one global variable
Usage: monty file
file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file , followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the name of the file
If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction , followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number where the instruction appears.
Line numbers always start at 1
The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
Commands coded in the interpretor
Push: Pushes an element into the stack.
Pall: Prints the values of the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
Pint: Prints the value at the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element of the stack
Swap: Swaps the two elements that are on top of the stack.
Add: Adds the two elements in the top of the stack.
Nop: The code does nothing.
Sub: Substracts the top element of the stack from the second top element.
